# Arizona-Highschool-Graduation-Rates
This project uses Snowflake and SQL to create a complex dashboard on the Four-Year Graduation Rates datasets from the Arizona Department of Education. According to the Arizona Department of Education, the datasets are a list of reports of four-year graduation rates in the State of Arizona. They include Arizona public schools, districts, and charter holders, and is broken down into School, LEA, County, and State level results. In these report, the term "cohort year" refers to the cohort a student is assigned when they first enter an Arizona public high school. For example, if a student enters 9th grade in 2017, they would be in cohort 2021 and would be included for the "Cohort 2021 Four-Year Grad Rate Data". However, if that same student needed a fifth year of high school in order to graduate, they would be included for the "Cohort 2021 Five-Year Grad Rate Data".
